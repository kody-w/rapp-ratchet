"""ratchet.py — one tick over the WORK, not the watchers.

    python3 ratchet.py tick        # run checks, emit three frames, anchor
    python3 ratchet.py verdict     # run checks, print, emit nothing
    python3 ratchet.py report      # one paragraph fit for a text message

A tick is deliberately cheap and invokes no model. It reads files, verifies
hashes, and appends. The expensive judgement — deciding what a finding MEANS —
is left to whoever reads the report, because a watcher that reasons about its
subject on every tick is a watcher with a budget, and a budget is a reason to
skip a tick.

Nothing here writes to the subject. That is a boundary in direction.json and
also just the design: every path below opens the subject read-only.
