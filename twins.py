"""twins.py — an independent four-twin neighborhood that watches the maintainer.

Deliberately standalone. It shares the `rapp/1` frame format with
kody-w/rapp-sentinel (vendored in rapp.py, authority kody-w/rapp-1) and shares
nothing else: its own identities, its own chains, its own anchor file, its own
launchd job. If the sentinel's whole directory were deleted, every frame here
would still verify.

That independence is the entire point. A watcher that stores its findings
inside the thing it watches can be silenced by the thing it watches.

Three twins, three vantages on the same question — "is the sentinel still doing
what it said it would?" They are separated because the failure modes are
genuinely different, and a single check that mixes them reports one verdict for
three unrelated reasons:

  ledger   — are its CLAIMS backed by evidence we gathered ourselves?
  compass  — does its declared GOAL still match the world it operates in?
  pulse    — is work still MOVING, or has it settled into permanent green?
